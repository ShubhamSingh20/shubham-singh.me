      <description>I am an undergrad student at Gujarat Technological University, currently persuing my undergrad in Computer Engineering. I have 3+ year of experience in developing applications using web based and native technologies. I have also worked as a freelance developer and help build software based solutions for multiple local businesses.
At this site I will be sharing some of my personal projects and I will also try to post technical articles related to programming on weekly or monthly basis.</description>
